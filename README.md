# Shiba
This repo is currently un-updated but will be updated with all of the updated code soon.

Shiba is a multi-purpose discord bot which runs on discord.js. The premium code is not in this repository, as this is the public build.
Many core files such as tokens, api links, and more will be missing.

The websites code will be released soon, however It is still a work in progress. https://shibabot.ga/


# Hosting
The bot is hosted with https://repl.it and https://uptimerobot.com/ which will probably get moved to a VPS or to a node with an i5 4570 @ 3.20 Ghz and 16GB of ddr3 ram. (with only 6 being dedicated to the bot until it needs more)


# Support Server
You can get support with the bot here: https://discord.gg/Mtzw8RuxGp


# Premium Info
The premium version of the bot will not be released publicly, as I'm waiting to figure out on how to setup said premium things, the bot needs to be fully finished first.


# The story behind the bot's name
Originally, I made the bot being that I had a bunch of friends using shiba pfps, in which I joined in and at the time I wanted to make a utility bot. And that is what I did.
