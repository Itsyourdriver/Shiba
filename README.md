# The Story Of The Bot
Originally, I made the bot being that I had a bunch of friends using shiba pfps, in which I joined in and at the time I wanted to make a utility bot. And that is what I did. I later made the bot public (and it was added to a few friends servers) later I prepared the code and hosting for going all out as I listed it on top.gg and is now working on 45 servers!
